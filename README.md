# UR-Stressed


Because of the use of camera, the code doesn't run from VS code. 
Please use a terminal.

Also, please make sure you can use the venv
```
source venv/bin/activate
export FLASK_ENV=development
pip install -r requirements.txt #...if custom modules were used
flask run #...then Ctrl-C to exit
```
